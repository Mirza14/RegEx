There are easier ways to match bigger charsets. For example, \d is used to match any single digit. Here's a reference:
\d matches a digit, like 9
\D matches a non-digit, like A or @
\w matches an alphanumeric character, like a or 3
\W matches a non-alphanumeric character, like ! or #
\s matches a whitespace character (spaces, tabs, and line breaks)
\S matches everything else (alphanumeric characters and symbols)

Note: Underscores _ are included in the \w metacharacter and not in \W. That means that \w will match every single character in test_file.

Often we want a pattern that matches many characters of a single type in a row, and we can do that with repetitions. For example, {2} is used to match the preceding character (or metacharacter, or charset) two times in a row. That means that z{2} will match exactly zz.

Here's a reference for each repetition along with how many times it matches the preceding pattern:

{12} - exactly 12 times.
{1,5} - 1 to 5 times.
{2,} - 2 or more times.
* - 0 or more times.
+ - 1 or more times.
