# RegEx
Regular expressions (or RegEx) are patterns of text that you define to search documents and match exactly what you're looking for.

# Why RegEX?
When searching for a specific string in a file or block of text, you can search for it as is, with "grep 'string' filename" . But what happens if you want to search for patterns of text? For example, you could be looking for a word that starts with a specific letter, or any words that end with numbers. That's where Regular Expressions come in.
